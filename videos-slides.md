{% include youtube.html video="g4Pv3cVkSIg" title="Discovering materials twice as fast at a fraction of the cost through Bayesian optimization" %}


In this talk given at the BO Hackathon for Chemistry and Materials '24, University of Utah professor **Dr. Taylor Sparks** describes the need for good data to leverage the Acceleration that comes from using data-driven methods, and the role that Bayesian optimization plays in exploring materials search spaces. Dr. Sparks also addresses the concept of multi-objective optimization and the need to consider tradeoffs between multiple properties of interest through Pareto frontiers.

{% include youtube.html video="OKHcwtefRsU" title="Industrial view on Bayesian optimization: A perfect match for the low/no-data regime" %}

Dr. Martin Fitzner from Merck KGaA describes the role that Bayesian optimization plays in industrial chemistry and materials settings where experiments are expensive and data is often scarce. Dr. Fitzner describes the advantages of merging expert scientific intuition with sophisticated algorithms through the use of custom chemical encodings within a Bayesian optimization framework. His talk also addresses the potential to use transfer learning (i.e., multi-task BO) to kickstart the optimization of related tasks.
