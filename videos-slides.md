In this talk given at the BO Hackathon for Chemistry and Materials '24, University of Utah professor **Taylor Sparks** describes the need for good data to leverage the Acceleration that comes from using data-driven methods, and the role that Bayesian optimization plays in exploring materials search spaces. Dr. Sparks also addresses the concept of multi-objective optimization and the need to consider tradeoffs between multiple properties of interest through Pareto frontiers.
