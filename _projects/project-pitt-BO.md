We will investigate the problem of structural color, which makes specific colors without chemical pigments, by finding an optimal nano-structure using Bayesian optimization. We will parameterize a thin-film structure considering the material and thickness of each layer, and then optimize a function of a distance to a target color with Bayesian optimization. In addition, we will showcase our own transfer-matrix method package for computing the propagation of electromagnetic waves as well as our Bayesian optimization package.
