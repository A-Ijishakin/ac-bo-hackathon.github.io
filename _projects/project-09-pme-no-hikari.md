Metal-organic frameworks are promising materials for carbon capture at large scale. In this work, we investigate the optimal MOF selection strategy to find top-performing candidates with the highest CO2 uptake. We adopt the CRAFTED MOF dataset and build Bayesian models with Thompson sampling acquisition function to perform candidate selection. We also benchmark Thompson sampling against other acquisition functions to compare their performance in finding top MOF candidates.
