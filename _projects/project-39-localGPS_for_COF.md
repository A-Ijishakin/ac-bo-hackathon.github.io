In this project, we will explore the application and performance of local GP models in the 
Bayesian Optimization framework to maximize Methane Deliverable Capacity of COFs. The
methane deliverable capacity is important as it amounts to the amount of natural
gas that can be stored on board vehicles. We use a database of 70,000 hypothetical
COFS for testing this method [1].
