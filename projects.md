## Project initialization

Multiple projects are OK. For example, one may wish to apply a particular algorithm to a benchmark *and* create a concept-focused instructional tutorial to accompany it. Each of these would be considered a separate project with its own template.

To initialize your project, please follow these steps:
1. Accept the GitHub Classroom invitation to a topic above
2. Create a new file in a fork of the hackathon repository named `project-<your-team-name>.md`. For example, if your team name is "Bayes Bandits", the file should be named `project-bayes-bandits.md`.
3. Copy the following contents into the file and fill in the corresponding details. Use the GitHub repository
