## Recommended Prerequisites

#### Python Programming

At least beginner to intermediate Python programming experience is recommended for participation in the hackathon. We recommend you complete an introductory Python course in preparation for the hackathon.

- [Python for Everybody by University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
- [Learn Python 3 by CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
- [Intro to Python Programming for Materials Engineers](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0SWcFqypCmkHClksnGlab3wglEVMqNN)
- [Python Beginners Guide for Programmers by Python Software Foundation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)

#### Git and GitHub

Basic familiarity with git and GitHub is recommended. Please familiarize yourself with the following resource in preparation for the hackathon.

## BO Tools

Use of the tools listed in this section is not a requirement. A diverse set of packages and implementations is encouraged. Likewise, multiple teams using the same package is not a problem, since implementations can remain private during the course of the hackathon. If you'd like to see a specific tool listed here, please navigate to the "Improve this page" link at the bottom of the page and open a pull request.

#### [Acceleration Consortium's curated list of optimization tools](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/awesome-self-driving-labs#optimization)

#### BayBE
This hackathon is co-organized by Merck KGaA. You may consider using an internal Merck tool that was recently open-sourced, called the [Bayesian optimization BackEnd (BayBE)](https://github.com/emdgroup/baybe). This tool focuses on real-world experimental campaigns in the physical sciences.
