## What is Bayesian optimization, and why is it important for the physical sciences?

Bayesian optimization is a key technique in chemistry and materials science, particularly useful for tackling complex experiments that are time-consuming and costly. It uses a smart model, often based on Gaussian Processes, to predict where to look next in an experiment to find the best results with minimal trials. This method is especially handy when dealing with experiments that don't have straightforward outcomes or involve a lot of variables, which is often the case in these fields. It's like having a smart assistant that tells you the most promising experiments to run next, helping you save time and resources. Moreover, Bayesian optimization is good at dealing with uncertain results through its smart handling of the exploration-exploitation trade-off. This approach helps speed up the discovery of new materials and chemical processes by making the experimental process more efficient and informed.

## Am I eligible to participate in the hackathon?

Yes! The hackathon is open to everyone, regardless of background or experience. We encourage participants from all career stages, including students, researchers, and professionals, to join us. At minimum, we recommend at least beginner or intermediate Python programming experience[<sup>(?)</sup>][faq]{:title="Do I need to use Python, or can I use other languages?"} and basic familiarity with git and GitHub. Prior to the hackathon, we also recommend that participants study the basic concepts behind Bayesian optimization. For those looking to learn or refresh their knowledge on these topics, please study the following resources in preparation for the hackathon.

### Python Programming

At least beginner to intermediate Python programming experience is recommended for participation in the hackathon. We recommend you complete an introductory Python course in preparation for the hackathon.

- [Python for Everybody by University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
- [Learn Python 3 by CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
- [Intro to Python Programming for Materials Engineers](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0SWcFqypCmkHClksnGlab3wglEVMqNN)
- [Python Beginners Guide for Programmers by Python Software Foundation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)

If you have no prior programming experience, you may wish to start with the following resource:
- [Python Beginners Guide for Non-programmers by Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)

### Git and GitHub

Basic familiarty with git and GitHub is recommended. We recommend you familiarize yourself with the following resource in preparation for the hackathon.

- [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://github.com/AC-Classroom/github-starter-course)

### Bayesian Optimization

A basic understanding of Bayesian optimization will help you get the most out of the hackathon. For those who are not yet comfortable with Bayesian optimization, please study the following resources in preparation for the hackathon:

## Are there specific packages I should use?

This is a BYOP ("bring-your-own-package") event ðŸ˜‰. We have some recommendations for newcomers, but we hope to see a diverse set of solutions applied to the benchmark tasks. Likewise, multiple teams using the same package is not a problem, since solutions can remain private during the course of the hackathon.

## Do I need to use Python, or can I use other languages?

We recommend using Python, as it is the most common language for scientific computing and has a wide range of libraries for Bayesian optimization. To be considered for the prizes, your implementation must be based in Python. However, you are welcome to use other languages if you prefer. If you choose a language other than Python, your project can still be highlighted on the projects page and elsewhere.

## Does it have to be Bayesian optimization, or are other algorithms allowed?

There is certainly a focus on Bayesian optimization, but you are welcome to use other algorithms. It would be best if there's some kind of adaptive design component to it, though this isn't a strict requirement. If you're unsure, feel free to reach out to the organizers.

## Is the hackathon a competition?

Yes, in some sense. Rather than collaborating on a single problem together, you will work either solo or in small teams to accomplish one of three tasks: applying a Bayesian optimization algorithm to one of the provided benchmark tasks, designing a new optimization benchmark, or creating concept-focused instructional tutorials. Each submission will be reviewed by a team of judges and evaluated based on a set of criteria laid out in the [project guidelines](projects.md). Prizes will be awarded accordingly.

## Do I need to have a team to participate?

No, you are allowed to participate as an individual. However, we encourage you to form a team with other participants to work on a project together. This will allow you to share ideas and learn from others! It is up to you to identify and form a team, and you can do so at any time leading up to the hackathon.

## What is required for me to participate in the scholarly article?

We would love to have you contribute to the manuscript! Depending on the level of involvement, you will be offered the opportunity to co-author or be acknowledged in the manuscript. The following are the criteria for co-authorship, which will be evaluated at the discretion of the organizing team:

- **Participation in the hackathon**: You must have participated in the hackathon to be eligible to contribute to the scholarly article. This is indicated in part by commit history, pull requests, and issues on the team's GitHub repository, as well as other public evidence of participation.
- **Complete project submission**: You or your team must have submitted a complete project. This includes a complete implementation of a Bayesian optimization algorithm, a new benchmark task, or a tutorial based on the provided templates. Additionally, this project must be made publicly available on GitHub and [licensed appropriately](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) (e.g., MIT License).
- **Completion of a CRediT form**: You must complete a CRediT form to be eligible for co-authorship. Additionally, you will need to acknowledge that your submitted work belongs to you, with the appropriate references and acknowledgements made. This form will be sent to you after the hackathon.

## Can I participate in multiple projects?

Yes, you may participate in multiple projects. For example, one may wish to apply a particular algorithm to a benchmark *and* create a concept-focused instructional tutorial to accompany it. Each of these would be considered a separate project with its own template. However, we encourage participants to be realistic about the limited time available during the hackathon as well as communicate this to other team members if participating in multiple projects.
