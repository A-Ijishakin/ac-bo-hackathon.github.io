## Are there specific packages I should use?

This is a BYOP ("bring-your-own-package") event ðŸ˜‰. We have some recommendations for newcomers, but we hope to see a diverse set of solutions applied to the benchmark tasks. Likewise, multiple teams using the same package is not a problem, since solutions can remain private during the course of the hackathon.

## Does it have to be Bayesian optimization, or are other algorithms allowed?

There is certainly a focus on Bayesian optimization, but you are welcome to use other algorithms. It would be best if there's at least some kind of adaptive design component to it.

## Is the hackathon a competition?

Yes, in some sense. Rather than collaborating on a single problem together, you will work either solo or in small teams to accomplish one of three tasks: applying a Bayesian optimization algorithm to one of the provided benchmark tasks, designing a new optimization benchmark, or creating concept-focused instructional tutorials. Each submission will be reviewed by a team of judges and evaluated based on a set of criteria laid out in the [project guidelines](projects.md). Prizes will be awarded accordingly.

## What is required for me to participate in the scholarly article?

Contributions will be listed based on co-authorship or acknowledgements, depending on the level of involvement.

The following are the criteria for co-authorship:

- **Participation in the hackathon**: You must have participated in or helped with the organization of the hackathon to be eligible to contribute to the scholarly article.
- **Complete project submission**: You must have submitted a complete project to be eligible for co-authorship. This includes a complete implementation of a Bayesian optimization algorithm, a new benchmark task, or a tutorial based on the provided templates. Additionally, this project must be made publicly available on GitHub and licensed appropriately.
- **Completion of a CRediT form**: You must complete a CRediT form to be eligible for co-authorship. This form will be sent to you after the hackathon.
